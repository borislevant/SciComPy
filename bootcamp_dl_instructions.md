## Syllabus

Python is a leading programming language for scientific research, data science, and machine learning. Thia course will familiarize students with the Python scientific stack and with best practices for scientific computing using methods from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, classical statistics, numerical analysis, Bayesian statistics, and artificial neural networks.

Every class will present a scientific problem, a computational method for tackling it, and a Python implementation of the method. Examples will include performing predicting points in tennis matches and survival on the Titanic, modelling evolutionary dynamics and infectious diseases, finding stationary points for a predator-prey system, inference in animal social networks, and classification of handwritten digits.
